# BuildLens: OCaml Build Tooling with Dune

### A Structured and Reproducible OCaml Build Workflow using Dune & opam

</div>

---

## 📌 Overview

**BuildLens** is an OCaml project focused on designing and managing structured build workflows using the **Dune build system** and **opam package manager**. It demonstrates how to configure, build, and manage OCaml projects efficiently with reproducibility and scalability in mind.

This project highlights practical usage of Dune for handling project metadata, dependency management, and automated build processes.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Dune-based build system** using S-expression configurations  
- 📦 **Dependency management with opam**  
- 🧱 **Multi-package project structure support**  
- 🔁 **Reproducible builds across environments**  
- ⚡ **Efficient and parallel build execution**  
- 💻 **Command-line build automation workflows**

## ⚙️ How It Works

Dune reads project configuration from `dune` files written in a simple **S-expression syntax**. These files define:

- Build rules  
- Libraries and executables  
- Dependencies  
- Compilation targets  

Dune then automatically handles compilation, linking, and environment setup, making OCaml development faster and more reliable.

## 💪 Strengths

### 🔹 Composable Architecture
Dune allows multiple OCaml projects to be combined into a single build system, enabling scalable and modular development.

### 🔹 Multi-Package Support
Supports repositories with multiple packages and ensures correct dependency resolution across them.

### 🔹 Reproducibility
Ensures consistent builds across different environments using defined configurations and dependency locking.

### 🔹 Performance
Optimized for fast builds with minimal overhead and support for parallel execution.

### 🔹 Developer Productivity
Reduces manual configuration and simplifies workflows through automation and standardization.
